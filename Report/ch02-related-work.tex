\section{Displaying 3D Models}

A pivotal aspect of this thesis revolves around the presentation of 3D models. Given the intended deployment of the application across diverse platforms, the implementation necessitates a cross-platform approach. 
To address this requirement, we derive inspiration from webGL and openGL, adapting their principles to develop a custom solution. 
Notably, a substantial portion of the rendering process is executed through the utilization of the Cube Flutter plugin, which we have tailored to align with our specific needs.


\section{Modification of 3D Models}

To facilitate the alteration of the 3D models, an adapted approach is employed, drawing inspiration from the methodology presented in the scholarly work by \textbf{Zwicker et al. (2004) titled "Perspective Shape from Shading."}

Wavefront OBJ files serve as the file format for storing the 3D models employed in this study. To facilitate their integration with the rendering engine, a parsing mechanism is implemented to extract the necessary geometric and texture information from the OBJ files. 
Subsequently, a conversion process is executed to transform the extracted data into a compatible format that can be seamlessly rendered by the rendering engine.

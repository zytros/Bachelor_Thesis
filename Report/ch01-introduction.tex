\section{Background}

The main goal of this thesis is to develop a cross-platform application that allows users to modify the appearance of the breasts and evaluate the potential outcomes of a surgical procedure. 
The application is intended to be used by plastic surgeons and their patients. 

One of the primary objectives is to incorporate similar functionalities as the \textbf{Lind App}, created by Arbrea Labs, into the application. 
The aim is to establish a unified codebase capable of operating on various platforms, with a particular focus on the web and Android.

\chapter{Introduction}

\section{Background}

Visualization of a potential outcome is a crucial aspect of any surgical procedure, especially if the procedure is cosmetic in nature. Through the use of 3D models, surgeons can
provide their patients with a visual representation of the potential outcome of a surgical procedure. This thesis is done in collaboration with Arbrea Labs, a company that specializes in the development of
software solutions for plastic surgeons. Arbrea Labs has developed a pipeline that allows surgeons to create 3D models of their patients' breasts. The dataset of 3D models used in this thesis is
provided by Arbrea Labs.



The main goal of this thesis is to develop a cross-platform application that allows users to modify the appearance of the breasts and evaluate the potential outcomes of a surgical procedure.

One of the primary objectives is to incorporate similar functionalities as the \textbf{Lind App}, created by Arbrea Labs, into the application. 
The aim is to establish a unified codebase capable of operating on various platforms, with a particular focus on the web and Android.
